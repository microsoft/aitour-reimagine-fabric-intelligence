# Use Copilot to Generate Queries

## ACCESS COPILOT TO GENERATE KQL QUERIES

Going back into this experience, you see I have Copilot directly available for me, and I can use this Copilot experience to generate the proper KQL queries to get me those results I'm looking for. 

In this case, I'm going to use Copilot to help me understand a bit more about the sales that I have across the different regions. 
WRITE QUERY IN COPILOT (NATURAL LANGUAGE)

I'm just going to type "sales data". 

Again, for all of the different sales regions that I have. 

By region, and I want to have this in a time chart, so I can see a bit more about my information. 

## COPILOT WRITES QUERY IN KQL FOR US

Just like that, it took my natural language and translated it into a proper KQL query that ultimately returns the results that I was looking for. 

You can see, even though that my natural language doesn't exactly match my database or the columns, it was able to translate it and figure it out. 

## SHOW THE RESULT IS INTERACTIVE (DRILL INTO DATA)

This result that it's generated is interactive. 

Right here, I can explore a bit more. 

For example, I can see that everybody spiked up around May 13, and I can even see more about the data. 

## USE COPILOT TO IMPROVE QUERY

But I want to go a little bit further, and I want to do the same query, but I only really care about sales in the last week. 

I only want to check if they're meaningful size. 

Let's say greater than 20 items in the sale. 

Once again, Copilot will take the query, the natural language that I've provided and generate a KQL query. 

You can see it's super powerful. 

## HIGHLIGHT COPILOT'S POWER FOR MAPPING NATURAL LANGUAGE TO FIELD NAMES

In this case, it actually even took the different fields, so it knew how to translate items, 20 items into a quantity filter. 

Then it also took my "in the last week" and put seven days, so super powerful and really gets me to the data that I want.
