# Set Real-Time Alerts with Data Activator

## SHOW DASHBOARD

We're going to go back into the dashboard. 

What you're going to see is that same capability that you saw in the Real-Time hub is also available directly from this Real-Time Dashboard as well. 

## SET ALERTS

For example, I can go to one of my tiles on the cost, and right from here, I can choose to set an alert. 

What this means is I'm going to be monitoring that query that I already pinned to my dashboard. 

It's already important enough to be monitored on the dashboard. 

Now I want to set that alert as well. 

## SEND ALERT TO TEAMS

It's going to immediately bring up that alert pane that you already saw. 

Now I want to be notified whenever the average cost is greater than 3,200 and in this case, send me a message on Teams. 

Just like that, I can create this item and save it into the workspace, even the existing reflex item that I already created. 

## SHOW DATA ACTIVATOR

Now I could go back to my dashboard and keep exploring, or I could actually open up the trigger and go into Data Activator and do even more with the capabilities. 

## SHOW DIFFERENT DATA ACTIVATOR ACTIONS

Now I'm in to Data Activator experience, I'm brought right to that action card, where you can see it says, I just set that Teams message, but there's many other actions I could take. 

I could send an e-mail with our Power Automate integration. 

I could kick off a workflow, lots of power and capabilities here. 

We also have the detection card. 

Although I set it for when it is greater than a specific value, I can also set it to alert when it exceeds a certain value and number of times in a time period, or if it exceeds that value and stays above it. 

What that allows me to do is really understand if this is a one-off case or if this is a concerning pattern that I need to keep an eye on. 

But again, this is all happening automatically, and I only to await the trigger. 

Simple, but powerful.
