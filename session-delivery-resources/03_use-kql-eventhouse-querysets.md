# Use KQL, Eventhouse, and Querysets to analyze real-time data

## ACCESS KQL DATABASES IN EVENTHOUSE

We're going to go back to the event stream, and this time, I'm going to choose my event house in KQL database and open it up directly from that experience. 

## EXPLAIN THE SYSTEM OVERVIEW PAGE

I'm brought into my event house where I can see a little bit more information about the different KQL databases that I have within the event house and how it's actually performing across the system. 

You can see from this view that I actually have multiple KQL databases, including the operations database, as well as the sales order database that we already routed to. 

The system overview page gives me a lot more information about how the actual system is performing in real-time. 

# OPEN KQL DATABASE

I'm going to open the KQL database that we routed our point-of-sale data into, and I can see all the information about the different tables that I have. 

## GET DATA FROM ONE LAKE

Even directly from this experience, I can choose to get data and connect to reference data that I already have either in my system in OneLake or in other sources as well. 

Since I already have my customer's data within Microsoft Fabric and in OneLake, I'm going to connect to it directly from this experience and bring it in so I can use it alongside my streaming data and make an even more powerful solution. 

## GO BACK TO EVENTHOUSE

In just a few clicks, I'm already connected, and I'm going to go back into this experience. 

## HIGHLY SCALABLE DB CAPABILITIES

For this demo we are using a “tiny” database, but Eventhouse can handle a lot more. 

Flipping over, here's an example of something with 110 terabytes in. 

## SHOW QUERYING CAPABILITIES

Could do a lot more on the querying side as well. 

But this experience makes it very easy. 

Out-of-box, you saw I had queries I can just select, and immediately, I get insights about my data. 

Of course, if I want to write queries, I can do so as well. 

## CREATE KQL QUERYSET FOR COLLABORATION

With this powerful capability, I can leverage a KQL queryset, so I can collaborate with others, share my queries, and keep exploring a little bit further. 

We're going to do that. 

We're going to create a new queryset, and gets us ready into our next pillar, which is all about AI in "Real-Time AI".
