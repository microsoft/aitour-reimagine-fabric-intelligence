# Real-Time Dashboards

PIN QUERYSET TO DASHBOARD

Going back into the queryset, I can see that last query we generated, and directly from this experience, I can pin it to a dashboard. 

I can choose an existing dashboard or a new dashboard, but I'm going to pin it to our existing "Deliveries" dashboard, give it a give it a name of “sales by region”, and then immediately open the dashboard from this experience. 
SHOW DASHBOARD

I'm taken into this dashboard where I can see that real-time streaming data across my organization. 

SHOW QUERY BEHIND TILE

I can do even more, for example, I can see the query that's underneath the tiles. 

MODIFY QUERIES

I can even go into edit mode and do even more maybe modify the queries or write some more KQL. 

EXPLAIN VISUAL QUERY EDITOR

If you don't know how to write code, we have a new visual exploration experience directly from this dashboard. 

What this allows is our business users who aren't familiar with writing code to actually use the visual experience to get further insights. 

DEMO VISUAL QUERY EDITOR

In this case, I see something where I want to understand a bit more about what the Eastern US sales region is doing. 

I'm going to remove the aggregation, add a quick filter, and now I'm going to add back the aggregation. 

But instead of grouping by day, I'm going to group all of my sales in two-hour chunks, so I can see even more about what was happening across that stream and really get insights about the data.
